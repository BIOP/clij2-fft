# clij2-fft: Fast GPU FFT based image processing algorithms for everybody

The goal of clij2-fft is to provide the bio-imaging community with fast but simple to use implementations of 2D and 3D FFT and FFT based algorithms (such as convolution and deconvolution). 

The clij2-fft project is built upon [clFFT](https://github.com/arrayfire/clFFT)  

clij2-fft is shipped as part of [clij2](https://clij.github.io).  Follow [these instructions](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/installationInFiji) to install clij2.
