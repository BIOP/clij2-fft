# clij2-fft: Fast GPU FFT based image processing algorithms for everybody

The goal of clij2-fft is to provide the bio-imaging community with fast but simple to use implementations of 2D and 3D FFT and FFT based algorithms (such as convolution and deconvolution). 

The clij2-fft project is built upon [clFFT](https://github.com/arrayfire/clFFT)
